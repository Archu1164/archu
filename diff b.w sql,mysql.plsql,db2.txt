what is the difference between sql,mysql,plsql,db2 ?

1. SQL (Structured Query Language)
SQL is a standard language used to manage and manipulate databases.
It is not a database, but a language used by most database systems.
Used for tasks like creating tables, inserting, updating, deleting, and querying data.
Works on relational databases.
Commands are divided into categories like DDL, DML, DCL, and TCL.

Example commands:

SELECT * FROM employees;
INSERT INTO students VALUES (1, 'Archana');

 2. MySQL
MySQL is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS).
It uses SQL language to interact with the database.
Developed by Oracle Corporation (open-source version also available).
Commonly used for web applications (like WordPress, PHP, Python apps).
Supports client–server architecture.
Fast, reliable, and widely used in modern web development.

Example:

CREATE DATABASE school;
USE school;
CREATE TABLE students (id INT, name VARCHAR(50));

3. PL/SQL (Procedural Language / SQL)
PL/SQL is Oracle’s procedural extension of SQL.
Adds programming features like loops, conditions, variables, and functions to SQL.
Used for writing stored procedures, triggers, and functions inside Oracle databases.
Helps perform complex business logic within the database itself.

Example:

DECLARE
  total NUMBER := 0;
BEGIN
  SELECT COUNT(*) INTO total FROM employees;
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Total Employees: ' || total);
END;

4. DB2
DB2 is an RDBMS developed by IBM.
Supports both SQL and NoSQL features in modern versions.
Mainly used in enterprise systems and large organizations (like banking).
Works on multiple platforms — Windows, Linux, UNIX, and IBM mainframes.
Offers high performance, security, and reliability.

Example (SQL command works the same way):

SELECT * FROM customers;
