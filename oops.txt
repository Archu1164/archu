1Class:
A class is a blueprint or template in OOP (Object-Oriented Programming).
It defines properties (variables/attributes) and behaviors (methods/functions) but does not hold actual data by itself.

*Think of a class like the design/blueprint of a house.

2.Object:
An object is an instance of a class.
When you create an object, Python allocates memory and the object holds actual data.

3.what is constructor
.Its main purpose is to initialize the objectâ€™s instance variables.
.It runs automatically when you create an object.
.You can pass arguments to the constructor to set initial values.

4.what is reference variable
.A reference variable is a variable that refers (points) to an object in memory.
.When you create an object, Python stores it in memory, and the variable just holds the reference (address) of that object, not the actual object itself.
.Multiple reference variables can point to the same object.
