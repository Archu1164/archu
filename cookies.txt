1.What Are Cookies?

Cookies are small pieces of data stored on the user’s browser by websites.
They help websites remember information about users — like login details, preferences, or shopping cart items.

2.>>How to Avoid Cookies?
 As a User:
.Block cookies in browser settings
→ Go to Settings → Privacy & Security → Cookies → choose
.Block all cookies, or
Block third-party cookies (recommended).
.Use Incognito / Private Mode
→ Temporary cookies only; deleted after you close the window.
Clear cookies regularly
→ Delete them manually from browser history.
.Use privacy extensions
→ Examples: uBlock Origin, Privacy Badger, Ghostery, Cookie AutoDelete.

>> As a Developer
1.Avoid Set-Cookie headers in the backend.
2.Use token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) instead of cookies.
3.Store authentication tokens in:
.localStorage
.sessionStorage
.or application memory.

3.What Happens If You Avoid Cookies?

>>You’ll need to log in every time (no “remember me”).
>>Shopping carts won’t save items between sessions.
>>Site preferences (theme, language, etc.) reset every visit.
>>No tracking or targeted ads — better privacy.
>>Some websites may not work properly (especially those using session cookies).
>>Slightly faster browsing due to fewer stored files.

//Best Practice

.Don’t block all cookies — block only third-party cookies for balance.
.Use token-based login systems in your apps instead of cookies.
.Clear cookies occasionally for better privacy and performance.
