What is a Token-Based Application?

A token-based application is one where the server issues a token (a unique string) to a user after they successfully log in.
This token is then used in every future request to verify their identity â€” instead of sending username/password each time.

Commonly used for:

>Authentication in APIs
>Secure communication between frontend & backend
>Session management
