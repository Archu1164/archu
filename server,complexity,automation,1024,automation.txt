1.what is Application server in cloud?
It's a server that runs and manages your app's backend(like api or logic)on the cloud.

EXAMPLES:AWS Elastic Beantalk,Google App Engine.
USE:
Handles request ,conects to databases ,and scales automatically


2.Space Complexity (Simple):
It is the amount of memory an algorithm uses while running.

Includes:
.Memory for variables
.Data structures
.Function calls

3.why 1024only not 1025?
Reason:
Computers work in binary (base-2), not decimal (base-10).
In binary, memory sizes are powers of 2.

So,
2¹⁰ = 1024
That’s why:
1 Kilobyte (KB) = 1024 bytes
1 Megabyte (MB) = 1024 KB
 .Not 1025, because 1024 is exactly a power of 2 — it fits perfectly in how computers
 count and store data in binary form (1s and 0s).

4.What is automation?
Automation:
Automation means using tools or scripts to perform tasks automatically instead of doing them manually — especially for testing software or web applications.

5.What is frame used to test the web application? 
.Framework Used to Test Web Applications:
.Common automation testing frameworks for web apps are:
.Selenium – Most popular for browser-based testing
.Cypress – Fast and modern for web UI testing
.Playwright – Newer tool by Microsoft, supports multiple browsers
.TestNG / JUnit – For structuring and running test cases (Java-based)
.Robot Framework – Keyword-driven and easy to use

6.BIOS?

BIOS stands for Basic Input/Output System.
It is a firmware (built-in software) stored on the motherboard of your computer.

::Main Functions:
.Starts the computer when you turn it on (boot process).
.Checks hardware like RAM, keyboard, and hard drive (POST – Power-On Self Test).
.Loads the operating system from storage into memory.
.Provides settings to configure hardware (like boot order, time, etc.).
