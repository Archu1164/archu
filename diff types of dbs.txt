1. Relational Databases (RDBMS)
Stores data in tables (rows and columns) with relationships between them.
Uses SQL (Structured Query Language).
Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server.
Best for: Structured data with clear relationships (like employee, student records).
>Example:
Students(id, name, age, grade)
Courses(id, course_name, student_id)

2. NoSQL Databases
Used for unstructured or semi-structured data (like documents, JSON, or graphs).
Does not use SQL strictly.
Very scalable and flexible.

3. Object-Oriented Databases
Data stored as objects (like in object-oriented programming).
Supports inheritance, encapsulation, etc.
>Examples: db4o, ObjectDB.
Best for: Applications built using object-oriented languages like Java or C++.

4. Distributed Databases
Data is stored across multiple physical locations or servers.
Increases availability and speed.
Examples: Google Spanner, Amazon Aurora, Cassandra.

5. Cloud Databases
Hosted and managed on cloud platforms.
Scalable and accessible from anywhere.
Examples: Amazon RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Azure SQL Database.

6. Hierarchical Databases
Data stored in a tree-like structure (parent-child relationship).
Example: IBM Information Management System (IMS).
Best for: Applications with one-to-many data relationships.

7. Network Databases
Similar to hierarchical but allows many-to-many relationships.
Uses network structure with nodes and links.
Example: Integrated Data Store (IDS).

8. Time-Series Databases
Optimized for storing time-stamped data (like sensor readings or stock prices).
Examples: InfluxDB, TimescaleDB.

9. Graph Databases
Focuses on relationships between entities (nodes and edges).
Examples: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune.
Used in: Social networks, recommendation systems.
