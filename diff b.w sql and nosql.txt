1.SQL (Structured Query Language) Databases:
.SQL databases are relational — data is stored in tables (rows and columns).
.They have a fixed schema, meaning structure must be defined before inserting data.
.Use SQL language for querying and managing data.
.Follow ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) for reliable transactions.
.Best suited for structured data and applications requiring strong relationships.
.Usually vertically scalable (by increasing hardware capacity of one server).

Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server.

2.QL (Not Only SQL) Databases:
.NoSQL databases are non-relational — data can be stored as documents, key-value pairs, graphs, or columns.
.They have a flexible or dynamic schema, allowing unstructured or semi-structured data.
.Do not use a standard query language (each database has its own query style).
.Follow BASE properties (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent).
.Best suited for large-scale, real-time, or unstructured data.
.Usually horizontally scalable (by adding more servers).

Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Firebase, CouchDB.
