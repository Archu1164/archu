SQL, both uppercase and lowercase are correct — SQL doesn’t care about case.
So these two mean exactly the same thing:

CREATE DATABASE mydb;
create database mydb;


Both are valid.
Keywords → use UPPERCASE (CREATE DATABASE)

Names (database, table, column) → use lowercase (mydb, students, name)

Recommended style:
CREATE DATABASE mydb;
This looks cleaner and is easier to read.
