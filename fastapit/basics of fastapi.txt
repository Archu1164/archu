1.What is FastAPI? 

FastAPI is a Python framework used to create APIs very quickly and easily.

⭐ Why is FastAPI popular? 
1.It is very fast
2️.Easy to use
3️.Automatically creates documentation
4️.Validates your input automatically
5️.Uses modern Python features

2.Difference Between FastAPI and Flask (Point-by-Point)
FastAPI:
.Built for speed using ASGI.
.Supports asynchronous code (async/await) by default.
.Automatic data validation using Pydantic.
.Auto documentation (Swagger & ReDoc generated automatically).
.Better performance for high-load APIs.
.Uses Python type hints heavily.
.Great for modern REST APIs and microservices.
.More secure due to built-in OAuth2 and security utilities.
.Less boilerplate code.
.Young framework but growing fast.

Flask:
.Uses WSGI, not designed for async by default.
.Simpler and lightweight, but manual work needed for validation.
.No built-in auto documentation.
.Best suited for small to medium apps.
.Avoided for high-performance or real-time systems.
.Flexible — you add extensions as needed.
.Very stable and older with huge community support.
.More suitable for beginners to learn web basics.
.Does not enforce type hints.
.Requires third-party libraries for big projects (Auth, DB, etc.)

3.what is ASGI and WSGI?
WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface):

.Synchronous (handles one request at a time).
.For traditional web apps (not real-time).
.Does NOT support WebSockets.
.Used by Flask, Django (older versions).

⭐ ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface):

.Asynchronous + Synchronous (handles many requests at once).
.Supports real-time features like WebSockets.
.Designed for high performance and concurrency.
.Used by FastAPI, Starlette, Django 3+

4.WHAT IS PYDANTIC?
Pydantic is a Python library that helps you validate and convert data
 easily using Python classes.

5.Why Dependency Injection? 
Reusability – same function can work with different objects.
Clean code – no need to create everything inside.
Easier testing – you can pass fake/mock objects.
Faster development – avoids repeating code.
