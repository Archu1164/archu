WHAT IS BOILER PLATE CODE?
Boilerplate code is the common, repeated code that appears in many programs or 
files, usually to set up the environment or basic structure.
1. Python Boilerplate Code
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()


This pattern ensures some code runs only when the file is executed,
not when imported.
