11.what does OR2 work?

.It can mean different things depending on where you saw it — for example
1.In Python or programming — there’s no built-in operator or function called or2.
Maybe you meant the logical operator or (used like if a or b:)?
2.In electronics or logic gates — “OR2” might refer to a 2-input OR gate, which outputs 1 (true) 
if either of the two inputs is 1.
3.In Excel or other software — it could be part of a function or formula name
 (like OR(A2, B2) meaning true if either cell A2 or B2 is true).

2.WHAT IS JWT?
JWT stands for JSON Web Token.
It’s a secure way to send information between two systems — like between a client (browser or app) and a server — in a compact, encrypted, and verifiable format.
>What JWT is used for:
Mainly for authentication and authorization in web applications.

1.Authentication:
When you log in to a website, the server checks your username & password.
If they are correct, the server creates a JWT and gives it to your browser.
That token proves you are logged in.

2.Authorization:
When you try to access a protected page (like your profile), your browser sends that JWT back to the server.
The server checks it — if it’s valid, you’re allowed in.
