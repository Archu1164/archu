11.what does OR2 work?

.It can mean different things depending on where you saw it — for example
1.In Python or programming — there’s no built-in operator or function called or2.
Maybe you meant the logical operator or (used like if a or b:)?
2.In electronics or logic gates — “OR2” might refer to a 2-input OR gate, which outputs 1 (true) 
if either of the two inputs is 1.
3.In Excel or other software — it could be part of a function or formula name
 (like OR(A2, B2) meaning true if either cell A2 or B2 is true).

2.WHAT IS JWT?
JWT stands for JSON Web Token.
It’s a secure way to send information between two systems — like between a client (browser or app) and a server — in a compact, encrypted, and verifiable format.
>What JWT is used for:
Mainly for authentication and authorization in web applications.

1.Authentication:
When you log in to a website, the server checks your username & password.
If they are correct, the server creates a JWT and gives it to your browser.
That token proves you are logged in.

2.Authorization:
When you try to access a protected page (like your profile), your browser sends that JWT back to the server.
The server checks it — if it’s valid, you’re allowed in.

3#.what is Hybernatw,Encrition,Decription and Cryptography?

1. Hibernate::
Hibernate means to save the current state and pause so you can continue later from the same point.

Example:
When you hibernate your laptop, all your open files and apps are saved on the hard disk.
Next time you turn it on, everything reopens exactly where you left it.
..Like pausing a movie and resuming later.

2. Encryption::
Encryption means changing readable information (plain text) into a secret code (cipher text) so that only authorized people can read it.

Example:
Plain text: HELLO
Encrypted (using a simple shift): KHOOR
— Only someone with the key knows how to turn KHOOR back into HELLO.
..Like locking a message in a box so only someone with the key can open it.

3. Decryption:
Decryption means converting the secret code (cipher text) back into readable text (plain text) using a key.

Example:
Cipher text: KHOOR
Decrypted (using the key): HELLO
..Like unlocking the box to read the original message.

4. Cryptography::
Cryptography is the science of protecting information by using encryption and decryption.
It keeps data safe, private, and unchanged.

Example:
When you send a message on WhatsApp, it uses cryptography so that only you and 
the receiver can read it — not even WhatsApp itself.
..Like sending a secret message that only your friend can open and read.
