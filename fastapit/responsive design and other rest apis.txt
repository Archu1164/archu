WHAT ARE OTHER ARCHITECTURES THAN REST API'S?
 
REST API (Representational State Transfer) is the most popular architecture style for web services — but it’s not the only one.
Here are the other major API architectures (or styles) besides REST 👇

1. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
An older, XML-based protocol.
Very strict and formal — used in enterprise systems (like banking, telecom, etc.).
Uses WSDL (Web Services Description Language) for describing APIs.
Communicates via HTTP, SMTP, etc.


2. GraphQL
Developed by Facebook.
Client can ask exactly for the data it needs, nothing more or less.
Uses a single endpoint (unlike REST which has many).
Returns JSON data.

3. gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call)
Developed by Google.
Uses Protocol Buffers (protobuf) instead of JSON or XML → very fast and compact.
Great for microservices communication.
Uses HTTP/2 (supports streaming and multiplexing).
.High performance
.Type-safe
.Harder to debug manually (binary data)

4. WebSockets
Used for real-time, two-way communication (like chat apps, games, or live notifications).
Unlike REST (request → response), both client and server can send messages anytime.

5. GraphQL Subscriptions / Server-Sent Events (SSE)
Both are used for real-time updates from the server.
SSE = server pushes updates automatically using HTTP.
GraphQL subscriptions are GraphQL’s version of real-time updates.

6. OData (Open Data Protocol)
Created by Microsoft.
REST-like, but adds querying features directly in URLs.
