1.Difference between port and socket?
Port:
.A port is a logical number that identifies a specific process or service on a device.
.Think of it like a door number in a building — it tells where the data should go.
.Ports range from 0 to 65535.

Example:

.Port 80 → HTTP (web traffic)
.Port 443 → HTTPS (secure web traffic)
.Port 25 → SMTP (email)

Socket:
A socket is the combination of an IP address and a port number.
It uniquely identifies a connection between two devices over a network.

Example:

192.168.1.10:8080
Here,

192.168.1.10 → IP address

8080 → Port number

Together → Socket
