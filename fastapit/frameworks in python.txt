Testing Frameworks in Python?
1️.unittest

Built-in Python testing framework
Uses a class-based structure
Supports test discovery, setup/teardown, and assertions
Good for beginners and standard library-level testing

2️.pytest

Most popular and widely used framework
Very simple syntax and powerful features
Supports fixtures, plugins, parameterized tests
Best choice for modern and large projects

3️.nose2

Successor to the now-deprecated Nose framework
Extends unittest with additional features
Supports plugins and test discovery
Mostly used in older or existing projects

4️.behave

BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) framework
Uses natural-language test cases (Given/When/Then)
Suitable for testing user stories and business logic

5️.robot framework

Keyword-driven testing framework
Used for automation testing (UI tests, API tests, RPA)
Easy for non-programmers due to simple syntax

6️.doctest

Runs tests based on examples in docstrings
Verifies that code examples in documentation work correctly
Useful for small utilities and documentation testing
