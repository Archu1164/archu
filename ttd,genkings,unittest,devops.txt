1. Test Driven Development (TDD)?
Meaning:
TDD means writing tests before writing actual code.
It’s a method to ensure code correctness from the start.

>>Steps (called the “Red → Green → Refactor” cycle)
.Write a test for a small function or feature (it fails at first).
.Write code to make that test pass.
.Run all tests — if they pass, you’re good.
.Refactor the code (clean it up) without breaking tests.
.Repeat for every new feature.

>>Benefits:
.Ensures fewer bugs
.Code is cleaner and well-structured
.Improves confidence when changing code
.Acts as documentation for what code should do

 2. DevOps
 Meaning:
DevOps = Development + Operations
It’s a culture and set of practices to bridge the gap between developers and system administrators.

>Goal
Automate the process from coding → testing → deployment → monitoring
Deliver software faster, safer, and continuously

Key DevOps Tools (Point-wise)
1. Version Control Tools:
Used to manage source code and track changes.

Git,GitHub,GitLab,Bitbucket

2. Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Tools:
Automate build, test, and deployment pipelines.
Jenkins,GitLab CI/CD,CircleCI,Travis CI,Azure DevOps

3. Configuration Management Tools
Used to manage and automate server setup and configuration.
Ansible,Chef,Puppet,SaltStack

4. Containerization Tools:
Package applications and dependencies together for consistent environments.
Docker,Podman

5. Container Orchestration Tools:
Manage, scale, and deploy multiple containers.
Kubernetes,Docker Swarm,OpenShift

6. Cloud Platforms:
Provide infrastructure and services for deployment and scaling.
AWS (Amazon Web Services),Microsoft Azure,Google Cloud Platform (GCP),IBM Cloud

7. Monitoring & Logging Tools:
Track performance, errors, and server health.
Prometheus,Grafana,Nagios,ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana),Splunk

8. Security & Compliance Tools:
Ensure safe and secure DevOps practices.
SonarQube (code quality)
,Vault (secrets management),Aqua Security,Snyk

9. Collaboration & Communication Tools:
Improve coordination between Dev and Ops teams.
Slack,Microsoft Teams,Jira,Confluence

Summary:
A DevOps pipeline generally includes:
Git → Jenkins → Docker → Kubernetes → Prometheus → Grafana

3. Unit Test Cases
 Meaning:
A unit test checks a small piece of code (function or class) to verify it works as expected.
Example in Python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def test_add():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5

>>You can run this using a testing framework like:
.unittest
.pytest

>>Benefits
.Detects bugs early
.Helps maintain code quality
.Makes refactoring safe (you know what breaks)

4. Jenkins
(You said “genkings” — it’s actually Jenkins) 
 Meaning:
Jenkins is an open-source automation server used for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD).

How It Works:
1.Developer pushes code to GitHub.
2.Jenkins automatically:
.Pulls the new code
.Runs tests
.Builds the project
.Deploys it to the server

Features:
.Automates repetitive tasks (build, test, deploy)
.Supports many plugins (Git, Docker, etc.)
.Core tool in DevOps pipelines
