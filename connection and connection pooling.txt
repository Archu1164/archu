What is a Connection in Databases?

A connection is a link between your application and the database.
It allows your program to send SQL queries and receive results.

It is used to:
.Execute SQL commands (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, etc.)
.Retrieve results
.Maintain communication with the database


What is Connection Pooling?
Connection pooling is a technique to reuse database connections instead of creating new ones each time.

 Why itâ€™s needed:
.Creating a new connection for every request is slow and expensive.
.Connection pooling keeps a set (pool) of open connections ready to use.

When an app needs to talk to the DB:
.It borrows a connection from the pool.
.When done, it returns the connection to the pool.
.The same connection can be reused by other requests.
