1.What is a vulnerability?

A vulnerability is a weakness in software, a configuration, or a process that an attacker  
can exploit to cause harm (data leak, takeover, service disruption, privilege escalation, etc.). 
In web apps this usually means bugs, bad configuration, or insecure dependencies that let an attacker do things they shouldn’t be able to.


2.how to find out web application vulnerability?
 
1.Get permission — only test sites you own or have written permission for.
2.Explore the site — click pages, forms, search, login, profile, upload.
3.Check HTTPS — look for the padlock in the browser address bar.
4.Look for IDs in URLs — /user/123 or ?id=45 — try changing the number.
5.Try a basic XSS test — paste <img src=x onerror=alert('test')> into a text field.
6.Test login/reset flows — try wrong usernames/passwords and watch error messages.
7.Check file uploads — upload a harmless test.txt and see if it’s publicly accessible or executable.
8.Check security headers — run curl -I https://example.com and look for HSTS/CSP/X-Frame-Options.
9.Look for exposed admin pages — try /admin, /wp-admin, /phpmyadmin.
10.Save evidence — URL, input used, and a screenshot for anything you find.
