Multithreading: This involves a single process running multiple threads concurrently,
 all sharing the same memory space.
 In Python (CPython), it's best for I/O-bound tasks (like network requests or file access) 
because the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) prevents true parallel execution of CPU-bound code.

Multiprocessing: This involves running multiple independent processes,
 each with its own dedicated memory space and Python interpreter. 
This allows for true parallel execution on multiple CPU cores, 
making it ideal for CPU-bound tasks (like heavy calculations).
