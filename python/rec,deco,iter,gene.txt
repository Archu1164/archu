Recursion
Definition: Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls 
directly or indirectly to solve a problem. It works by breaking down 
a complex problem into smaller, similar sub-problems until a base 
case is reached, which provides a direct solution.

Decorator
Definition: A decorator in Python is a design pattern that allows you to 
add new functionality to an existing function or class without modifying 
its structure. It essentially "wraps" another function, taking it as an 
argument and returning a new function that usually extends or modifies 
the original's behavior.

Generator
Definition: A generator in Python is a special type of function 
that generates values on the fly using the yield keyword, rather
 than returning a single value. It creates an iterator that can 
be paused and resumed, saving memory by producing values one at 
a time only when requested, making it ideal for large datasets.

Iterator
Definition: An iterator is an object that represents a stream of 
data and allows you to traverse through elements one by one. 
It implements two methods: __iter__ 
(which returns the iterator object itself) and __next__ 
(which returns the next item in the sequence, 
raising StopIteration when no more items are left)
