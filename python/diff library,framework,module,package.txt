DIFF B/W LIBRARY,FRAMEWORK,MODULE,PACKAGE??

1. Module
.A single Python file (.py file).
.Contains functions, classes, or variables.
.Smallest unit.

Example:
math.py, random.py, your own file utils.py.

2. Package
.A collection of modules stored together in a folder.
.Has an __init__.py file.

Example:
numpy (contains many modules)
pandas
sklearn

3. Library
.A collection of packages and modules that provide specific functionality.
.You use it when you need certain features — you control the flow.

Example:
Pandas → data analysis library
NumPy → numerical computation library
Requests → HTTP library
Important: You call the library; the library doesn’t control you.

4. Framework
A large structure that provides rules and architecture for building applications.
Framework controls the flow — you follow its pattern.
More powerful than a library.

Example:
Django → web framework
FastAPI → web framework
Flask → micro-framework

Difference:
Library → you call functions
Framework → it calls your code (Inversion of Control)
