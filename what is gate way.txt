what is api gateway?
An API Gateway is a server that acts as a single entry point for all client requests to your backend services (like microservices, databases, or other APIs).

Key Functions of API Gateway:

1.Request Routing – Sends the request to the correct backend service.
2.Authentication & Authorization – Verifies user tokens before allowing access.
3.Load Balancing – Distributes traffic evenly across multiple servers.
4.Rate Limiting – Prevents too many requests from overloading the system.
5.Caching – Stores frequent responses to reduce backend load.
6.Logging & Monitoring – Tracks API performance and errors.
7.Request Transformation – Modifies requests or responses if needed (e.g., format conversion).

>> Why API Gateways are Used

.To simplify client interaction (one endpoint for all services)
.To improve security (control access centrally)
.To reduce complexity (clients don’t need to know internal structure)
.To enable microservices communication efficiently
