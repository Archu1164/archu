3#.what is Hybernatw,Encrytion,Decryption and Cryptography?

1. Hibernate::
Hibernate means to save the current state and pause so you can continue later from the same point.

Example:
When you hibernate your laptop, all your open files and apps are saved on the hard disk.
Next time you turn it on, everything reopens exactly where you left it.
..Like pausing a movie and resuming later.

2. Encryption::
Encryption means changing readable information (plain text) into a secret code (cipher text) so that only authorized people can read it.

Example:
Plain text: HELLO
Encrypted (using a simple shift): KHOOR
— Only someone with the key knows how to turn KHOOR back into HELLO.
..Like locking a message in a box so only someone with the key can open it.

3. Decryption:
Decryption means converting the secret code (cipher text) back into readable text (plain text) using a key.

Example:
Cipher text: KHOOR
Decrypted (using the key): HELLO
..Like unlocking the box to read the original message.

4. Cryptography::
Cryptography is the science of protecting information by using encryption and decryption.
It keeps data safe, private, and unchanged.

Example:
When you send a message on WhatsApp, it uses cryptography so that only you and 
the receiver can read it — not even WhatsApp itself.
..Like sending a secret message that only your friend can open and read.
