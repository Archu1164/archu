2.What is Microservices?

Microservices is a way of building an application by dividing it into small, independent parts (services).
Each service does one specific job and can work on its own.
# Example:
Think of an online shopping website — it can have:
Product Service – manages products
User Service – manages users
Payment Service – handles payments
Delivery Service – tracks orders
Each one is a microservice, and all together make the full app.
# Key Points:
Each microservice runs independently
They talk to each other using APIs
Easy to update, test, and scale
If one service fails, others still work

3.What is Netflix Microservices?
Netflix is one of the best examples of using microservices architecture.
Earlier, Netflix had one big app (called a monolith) — it became hard to manage as users grew.
So, they broke it into hundreds of microservices.

#How Netflix Uses Microservices:
Login Service – handles user authentication
Recommendation Service – shows movies you might like
Streaming Service – plays the video
Billing Service – manages subscriptions
Notification Service – sends emails or alerts
All these services work together, but independently.

# Netflix Built Tools for Microservices:
Netflix even created special tools for handling its microservices:
Eureka – Service discovery
Zuul / API Gateway – Routes requests to the right service
Hystrix – Handles failures safely
Ribbon – Load balancing

What are Variable Length Parameters in Python?
Sometimes you don’t know how many values (arguments) will be passed to a function.
So, Python lets you create functions that can take any number of arguments — these are called variable length parameters.

#Two Types:
*args → for multiple positional arguments
**kwargs → for multiple keyword arguments

Parameter	:The name used in the function definition (like num, *args, **kwargs)
Argument	:The actual value passed when calling the function (like 5, 10)
