What is Open Source?
Open source means the source code of a software is public — anyone can:
.See how it works:
.Use it for free
.Modify it
.Share their changes

Example:
Python, Linux, VS Code, FastAPI, and Firefox are open-source projects.
You can go to GitHub, open their code, and even improve it.

Opposite of Open Source

Closed Source (or proprietary software) — code is private.
Example: Microsoft Office, Netflix, Windows.

1. Understand What Open Source Means

Open source means the source code is public — anyone can view, modify, and improve it.

3. Understand the Project
Before you contribute:
.Read the README.md (what the project does)
.Check CONTRIBUTING.md (how to contribute)
.Look at issues and pull requests (PRs)
.Understand the code structure

4. Set Up the Project Locally

Typical steps:

# Step 1: Fork the repository (copy to your GitHub)
# Step 2: Clone it to your system
git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git

# Step 3: Go inside the project folder
cd project-name

# Step 4: Install dependencies (example for Python)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Step 5: Run and test
python main.py

git checkout -b fix-typo-in-readme


Make your edits → test → commit:

git add .
git commit -m "Fixed typo in README"

7. Push and Create a Pull Request
git push origin fix-typo-in-readme
Then go to GitHub → open your repo → click “Compare & pull request”.

Add:
A short title

A clear description of what you changed

8. Wait for Review
