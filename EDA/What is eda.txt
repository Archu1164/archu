WHAT IS EDA?

EDA means Exploratory Data Analysis.
Simple Explanation:

EDA is the first step in data analysis where you try to understand your data before building any model.

Why EDA is important?
.To understand what your data contains
.To find mistakes or missing values
.To find patterns
.To decide which features are important
.To choose the right model later

What do we do in EDA?

1.View data (head, tail, shape)
2.Check missing values
3.Check data types
4.Summary statistics (mean, median, std…)
5.Visualizations like

.Bar chart
.Histogram
.Box plot
.Scatter plot

6.Find correlations between columns
