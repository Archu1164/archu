WHAT IS Pandas::

1.Pandas is a data analysis library in Python.
2.It works mainly with DataFrames (tables with rows & columns).
3.Used to load, clean, filter, and analyze data.
4.Supports reading data from CSV, Excel, SQL, JSON.
5.Provides useful functions like:
.head()
.info()
.describe()
.isnull()

6.Handles missing values, duplicates, and data types.
7.Very useful for EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis).
8.Built on top of NumPy.

WHAT IS NumPy:: 

1.NumPy is a numerical computing library in Python.
2.Uses ndarray (N-dimensional array) for fast calculations.
3.Much faster than Python lists.
4.Used for math operations, matrix calculations, and scientific computing.
5.Foundation for many libraries like Pandas, SciPy, Scikit-learn.
6.Supports operations like:
.np.array()
.np.mean()
.np.sum()
.np.dot()

7.Very important in machine learning, data science, and AI.
