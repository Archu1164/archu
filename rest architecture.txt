REST Architecture (Normal Explanation)

REST means Representational State Transfer.

it is way of designing web services where communication happens over https using standard methods like
GET:read data
POST:Crate data
PUT:update data
DELETE:
remove data
>client and server are independent
>uses resorces(like users,products,identified by urls.
>data is usually sent json.
>it is stateless:each request contains all the info needed ,server doesn't store client state

HOW DO YOU TEST APIs?
Testing API means checking if the work as expected
comon ways to Test APIs

Manual Testing with Tools:
Use tools like Postman, cURL, or Insomnia.
You send requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to the API and check if the response is correct.

Write test scripts using frameworks:
Python → pytest, unittest, requests library
JavaScript → Jest, Mocha, Supertest
These tests run automatically and check if APIs work as expected.
Check Important Things:

.Status Codes → 200 (success), 404 (not found), 500 (server error), etc.
.Response Body → Does it return the correct data?
.Headers → Check content type (JSON, XML).
.Performance → Is the response fast?
.Security → Authentication, authorization, input validation.

Web Application
A web application is a type of software program that runs on a web server and you can use it through a web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge
How it Works:
You open a browser and type a website address (URL).
The browser sends a request to the web server.
The server processes it (maybe using Python, Java, PHP, etc.) and sends back a response (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
You see the result as a web page or app screen.
